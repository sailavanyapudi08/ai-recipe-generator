This project demonstrates how to build a serverless AI-powered web application using AWS Amplify, Amazon Bedrock, and React. The application—AI Recipe Generator—allows users to input a list of ingredients and generates creative recipe suggestions using Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet model via Amazon Bedrock.

•	Serverless architecture using AWS Amplify and AWS Lambda  
•	Static site hosting with continuous deployment from GitHub  
•	User authentication via AWS Amplify Auth (Amazon Cognito)  
•	Generative AI integration using Amazon Bedrock’s Claude 3 model  
•	GraphQL API for flexible and efficient data interaction  
•	Modern frontend built with React and TypeScript (via Vite)
